# Authentor
User authentication form using Python and Eel.

This is not intended to be a fully functioning app, but something to integrate with another app, but I've included an installer incase you want to use it like that.

# Usage
It's pretty straight-forward, launch the app and log-in, or register a new account. The passwords are hashed for security
